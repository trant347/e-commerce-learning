We can achieve this in Docker without disrupting other containers using docker compose (if you're using it) or individual docker commands. Here's how to do it effectively:
You can achieve this in Docker without disrupting other containers using docker compose (if you're using it) or individual docker commands. Here's how to do it effectively:

1. Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Multi-Container Applications):

Stop and Remove the Specific Container:

If your application is managed by Docker Compose, navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file.

Use the following command, replacing your_service_name with the name of your service in the docker-compose.yml file:

Bash

docker compose stop your_service_name
docker compose rm -f your_service_name
The stop command gracefully stops the container, and rm -f removes it. The -f force removes it, even if it is running.

Pull the Updated Image:

Pull the latest version of your Docker image:

Bash

docker compose pull your_service_name
Run the Updated Container:

Use the docker compose up command with the -d flag (detached mode) to start the updated container:

Bash

docker compose up -d your_service_name
This will only recreate the service that was stopped, leaving the other services running.
